        <p>I am a big ol' nerd who experiences the world as numbers and logic.  In my years as a professional baker, I saw baking bread as engineering and strived for improvements with each daily bake.  I recently returned to my roots as a mathlete and took a software engineering immersive through General Assembly, where I found I have an ability to learn quickly and a love of coding.  To me, it's been a natural shift to a new form of engineering, where I can instantly see the results of an experiment.</p>
